Steps

// PLAY
Install Half-Life Alyx.
Install SteamVR.
To launch game, go to "game/bin/win64/hlnonvr.exe"
DO NOT USE THE SOURCE2MOD.EXE - its broken.

// DEV
Installing Workshop tools worked.

Created the root folder
Copied gameinfo.gi and gameinfo_branchspecific.gi
Copied cfg folder.
Create symlinks for pack01_dir and all _001 files. NOTE: I dont think this is required anymore - it seems to work regardless.
Changed title, and searchPaths for Mod and Write.
